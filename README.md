# Find Your Hat

## How to Play
 Copy the js code and input into your local js editor, then save. 

 Open your terminal **(must have node installed)** and go to the directory you saved the file in.

 Type node findhatgame.js or node (whatever you saved file name as .js) into your terminal and the game will begin. 

"**u**" is up, 

"**d**" is down,

"**l**" is left,

"**r**" is right.

Hit enter after your input.

The goal is to get to your hat **^**.  
If you fall in a hole **O**, go off the map, or backtrack you will lose. 

If you'd like to create your own field find the **const myField = new Field** section and alter the array however you choose.  
Add as many columns or rows as you like.
